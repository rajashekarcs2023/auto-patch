# 🧠 Self-Improving MCP Agent
## Revolutionary Tool Learning System

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED

**Current agents waste time using wrong tools and never learn from experience**

- ❌ Agents randomly pick tools without knowing what works
- ❌ No learning from successful/failed tool usage  
- ❌ Same mistakes repeated over and over
- ❌ No memory of what worked before

---

## 💡 OUR SOLUTION

**Self-improving agent that learns optimal tool selection through experience**

### Core Innovation: **Tool Intelligence Learning**

1. **🎯 Tool Selection Learning**: Learns which tools work best for different task types
2. **🧠 Smart Memory Evolution**: Automatically identifies and removes useless memories
3. **📝 Context Optimization**: Learns which context/memory is actually helpful  
4. **📈 Performance Tracking**: Continuously improves based on real outcomes
5. **🔄 Runtime Adaptation**: Gets smarter during deployment, not just training

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **22 Real MCP Tools Integrated**
- **Firecrawl**: 8 tools (scraping, crawling, extraction)
- **Vapi**: 8 tools (voice calls, assistants, telephony)  
- **Perplexity**: 4 tools (search, research, reasoning)
- **Airbnb**: 2 tools (search, property details)

### **Self-Improvement Architecture**
```
Task Request → Tool Selection → Execution → Outcome Evaluation → Learning Update
     ↑                                                               ↓
