REASONING EVOLUTION DEMONSTRATION
============================================================
Test Problem: Design a secure OAuth2 implementation for a distributed microservices architecture

BASELINE REASONING PATTERN:
For technical problems, reason as follows:

1. ANALYSIS: Break down the technical requirements and constraints
2. HYPOTHESIS: Identify the most likely solution approach
3. VERIFICATION: Test the approach against known cases
4. CONCLUSION: Provide concrete implementation steps

Performance: 0.00

SIMULATING LEARNING PROCESS...
REASONING EVOLVED: tech_001 -> technical_001

EVOLVED REASONING PATTERN:
For technical problems, reason as follows:

1. ANALYSIS: Systematically decompose the problem into core components and identify critical constraints
2. HYPOTHESIS: Identify the most likely solution approach
3. VERIFICATION: Test each hypothesis against known principles and edge cases
4. CONCLUSION: Provide concrete implementation steps


KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
• More systematic analysis approach
• Enhanced hypothesis generation
• Better verification methods
• Meta-reasoning for complex problems

EVOLUTION METRICS:

REASONING EVOLUTION DEMONSTRATION
============================================================
Test Problem: Design a secure OAuth2 implementation for a distributed microservices architecture

BASELINE REASONING PATTERN:
For technical problems, reason as follows:

1. ANALYSIS: Break down the technical requirements and constraints
2. HYPOTHESIS: Identify the most likely solution approach
3. VERIFICATION: Test the approach against known cases
4. CONCLUSION: Provide concrete implementation steps

Performance: 0.00

SIMULATING LEARNING PROCESS...
REASONING EVOLVED: tech_001 -> technical_001

EVOLVED REASONING PATTERN:
For technical problems, reason as follows:

1. ANALYSIS: Systematically decompose the problem into core components and identify critical constraints
2. HYPOTHESIS: Identify the most likely solution approach
3. VERIFICATION: Test each hypothesis against known principles and edge cases
4. CONCLUSION: Provide concrete implementation steps


KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
• More systematic analysis approach
• Enhanced hypothesis generation
• Better verification methods
• Meta-reasoning for complex problems
